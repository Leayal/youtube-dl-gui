# youtube-dl-gui
## User interface for [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) on windows, written in C#. This is a GUI on top of the CLI tool, which means you still need to get `youtube-dl.exe`.

### Notes:
- The tool will try to discover the CLI executable from `PATH`.
- You can browse for `youtube-dl.exe` in case the GUI can't discover or for your own convenience.
